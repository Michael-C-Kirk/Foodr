# Foodr

Foodr recommends food places for users either through one of our 3 quick search buttons, or through a machine learning algorithm that recommends you food based on your mood, time of day, and other factors. Every time one "thumbs up" a restaurant to learn more about it, a decision tree classifier makes a better prediction for a restaurant the user may like.
